# Founder's Choice 

### Update 
We've officially launched our first leaderboard. Future leaderboards will be updated every three months. 

### About 
Choosing the right partners to sit on your cap table is one of the hardest decisions that a founder has to make. The wrong choice is difficult to undo. Without knowing the right people, it can be difficult to get reliable information on which firms to choose. We hope that by collecting and processing venture-backed founder preferrences of investors, we can democratize access to this information, allowing founders to easily find the VC firms who are right for them. We verify that all founders are only able to contribute to the rankings of VCs that have actually invested in their startup. 

If you are a venture-backed founder, we would love for you to make comparisons on our site! Finishing all the comparisons should only take a few minutes and you can stop whenever you'd like. Some founders who've completed it so far have even called it fun.

### Identity Verification
In order to verify a Founder's identity, we use a combination of Linkedin and Crunchbase. This way, founders can only compare VCs that have actually invested in them. 

### Ranking Algorithm 
We use an Elo-based algorithm , which asks founders to make pair-wise comparisons among the VCs they’ve worked with. The advantage of this system is that it only accepts ratings from founders who have actually worked with these VCs, and it preserves anonymity of the founders while avoiding the vitriol on other review sites.

### Data Security 
We take founder's data very seriously. Although we authenticate all founders through their LinkedIn profiles, we only store that data temporarily for authentication purposes. As soon as founders start submitting comparisons, we hash their identity, and unlink their hashed identity from the ratings they've made, so no one can ever connect a founder's ratings back to them. To be as secure as possible, all our code (as you can see here) is open-sourced. Our code’s been reviewed by engineers at venture-backed companies, we’re trying to do this as carefully as possible.
